      I believe
      she spent her last moments trying to figure out a way to save you.

    dialogue: 'My speculation differs from yours.

      I believe... that she was
      hesitant.

      She was hesitant about deceiving you... as well as about
      killing someone.

      That hesitation is what led to her failure.

      It''s
      an ironic twist of fate.'
